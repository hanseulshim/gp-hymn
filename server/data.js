That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.`,
    v2: `‘Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed!`,
    v3: `Thro’ many dangers, toils, and snares,
I have already come;
‘Tis grace hath bro’t me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.`,
    v4: `The Lord has promised good to me,
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.`,
    v5: `When we’ve been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we first begun.`,
