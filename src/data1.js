		lyrics: `A mighty fortress is our God
			a bulwark never failing;
			Our helper He, amid the flood
			of mortal ills prevailing:
			For still our ancient foe 
			doth seek to work us woe;
			His craft and power are great, 
			and, armed with cruel hate,
			On earth is not his equal.

			Did we in our own strength confide, 
			our striving would be losing;
			Were not the right Man on our side, 
			the Man of God’s own choosing:
			Dost ask who that may be? 
			Christ Jesus, it is He;
			Lord Sabaoth, His Name, 
			from age to age the same,
			And He must win the battle.

			And though this world, with devils filled,
			should threaten to undo us,
			We will not fear, for God hath willed 
			His truth to triumph through us:
			The Prince of Darkness grim, 
			we tremble not for him;
			His rage we can endure, 
			for lo, his doom is sure,
			One little word shall fell him.

			That word above all earthly powers, 
			no thanks to them, abideth;
			The Spirit and the gifts are ours
			through Him Who with us sideth:
			Let goods and kindred go, 
			this mortal life also;
			The body they may kill: 
			God’s truth abideth still,
			His kingdom is forever.`

			Just to rest upon His promise,
			And to know, \"Thus says the Lord!\"

			Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
			How I've proved Him over and over
			Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
			O for grace to trust Him more!

			O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
			Just to trust His cleansing blood;
			And in simple faith to plunge me
			’Neath the healing, cleansing flood!

			Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
			Just from sin and self to cease;
			Just from Jesus simply taking
			Life and rest, and joy and peace.

			I'm so glad I learned to trust Him,
			Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend;
			And I know that Thou art with me,
			Wilt be with me to the end.`

			That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.

			Great things He hath taught us, 
			Great things He hath done,

			But we never can prove 
			The delights of His love
			Until all on the altar we lay;
			For the favor He shows 
			And the joy He bestows
			Are for them who will trust and obey.

			Then in fellowship sweet, 
			We will sit at His feet
			Or we’ll walk by His side in the way;
